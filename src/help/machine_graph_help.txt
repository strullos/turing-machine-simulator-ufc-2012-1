The Machine Graph editor can create .gmt files. 

These files are a graphical representation of the Turing Machine. They can be exported to a .mt file.

To create a Graph Machine file, add a node for each state on the Turing Machine (clicking on the + button).
You can connect the nodes to create transitions. 

To add a transition click on a node and drag the mouse to another node.
Double click on the created edge to edit the rule.

You can rename a node by double-clicking on it.

A Turing Machine needs to have an initial state. To set the initial state, select a node and click on 
the "Flag" button. The initial state node should turn to a green color.

The rules have the following format:

symbol;action

The actions can be: 

1. >  ---- Moves the reading head 1 position to the right
2. <  ---- Moves the reading head 1 position to the left
3. x  ---- In which 'x' represents any character. This action write the character 
represented by 'x' in the tape, on the position pointed by the tape's head. The reading head
is represented by a '_' character right before the symbol.
