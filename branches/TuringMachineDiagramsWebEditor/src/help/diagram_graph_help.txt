The Diagram Graph editor can create .gdt files. 

These files are a graphical representation of the Turing Machine. They can be exported to a .dt file.

To create a Diagram Graph file, add a node for each state you would like on the Diagram.
To add a state, it is first required to add modules, on the Modules menu on the right.
A state has to be binded to a Module, always.

To add a transition click on a node and drag the mouse to another node.
Double click on the created edge to edit the rule.

You can rename a node by double-clicking on it.

A Turing Machine Diagram needs to have an initial state. To set the initial state, select a node and click on 
the "Flag" button. The initial state node should turn to a green color.

The rules have the following format:

"[symbols]"

Example:
[a,b,c]
